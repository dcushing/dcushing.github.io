I'm a self-taught software developer based in Austin, TX who loves working with Swift and developing iOS apps. I also have experience with Ruby, JavaScript, Node.js, Apache Cordova, PostgreSQL, and Git, although my main focus is mobile development.

I am happily employed and am not currently looking for new opportunities.

I have a bachelor degree in linguistics. I can talk about linguistics for hours, and it's given me a lot of useful analytical skills that apply to coding. My career has been built on learning new skills on the go, and I enjoy the challenge of learning a new language or framework.
